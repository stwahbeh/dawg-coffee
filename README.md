##### 1. What is the URL of this site, as hosted on your student webserver (i.e., students.washington.edu/<code>{uw-new-id}</code>/info343/<code>{project-name}</code>) #####
http://students.washington.edu/stwahbeh/ass2/dawg-coffee/

##### 2. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
> I struggled a lot with this assignment. I had never done any web dev before this class. So I ended up asking Seung a few questions on how different css elements work and Arvind in another class on bootstrap concepts.

##### 3. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
> I completed the assignment which was already advanced enough for me :p

##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> I probably spent like 20+ hours on the assignment. A lot of the time was getting familiar with bootstrap elements and getting random things to work. I still have quite a few questions on why certain orders of elements work while others don't

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> It turns out a lot of the problems I was having was because bootstrap wasn't implemented correctly.
